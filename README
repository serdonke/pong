Pong clone....again...

This repo sure has more build files than project files...

Build on linux:

The `build.sh` script can build with or without cmake.

Without cmake it requires that raylib headers and static library files are stored at `../raylib/src`

`./build.sh`

Build on Windows:

`make` builds for windows (requires `gcc` in PATH) and raylib headers and static library file are stored at `../raylib/src`

The `build.bat` possibly works as well (not tested yet), it basically calls Cmake and takes care of building raylib as well
